                <p> Starting as childhood friends in Canada, Hamzah and Martin built Slushy Noobz from the ground up, blending humor, spontaneity, and a love for digital content. Their rise was fueled by an experimental approach—mixing gaming with real-life antics—that set them apart from polished, mainstream creators. Unlike many influencers chasing trends, they leaned into authenticity, creating a space that felt more like a chaotic hangout than a curated brand.  As their audience grew, so did their ambition. They branched into unscripted challenges, unconventional mukbangs, and even live events, culminating in their viral boxing match. This adaptability has cemented them as more than just YouTubers—they’re entertainers who thrive on unpredictability, keeping their fans constantly guessing what they'll do next..
