    <h2>The History of Baby Pink</h2>
    <p>Baby pink, a delicate and soft variation of pink, first gained widespread recognition in Western culture during the late 19th century. Prior to this period, pink was not strongly associated with gender and was actually often considered a masculine color due to its relationship to red, which symbolized strength and warfare. The specific shade we now know as baby pink emerged alongside the Victorian era's emphasis on childhood innocence and the growing commercialization of infant clothing and nursery items. The development of synthetic dyes in the 1850s made it possible to create consistent, reliable pink hues that could be mass-produced for the first time. In fashion magazines and retail catalogs of the 1880s, baby pink began appearing as a distinct color choice for infant clothing and accessories. The shade was particularly popularized by the wealthy classes who could afford the newest synthetic dyes and fashionable baby items.
