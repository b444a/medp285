            <h2>RISE OF A NEW ERA</h2>
            <p>In the early 1990s, a new sound began to take shape in the underground music scene. Mixing elements of heavy metal, hip-hop, and grunge, bands like Korn and Deftones pioneered what would later be known as **Nu Metal**. The genre rejected traditional guitar solos in favor of heavy, downtuned riffs and raw, emotional lyrics that spoke to a generation of disaffected youth.</p>

            <h2>THE GOLDEN AGE</h2>
            <p>By the late 1990s and early 2000s, Nu Metal had exploded into the mainstream. Bands like **Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Slipknot, and System of a Down** dominated MTV and radio stations, filling arenas with fans eager for their aggressive, hybrid sound.</p>

            <h2>DECLINE & LEGACY</h2>
            <p>As the 2000s progressed, Nu Metal's popularity declined, giving way to metalcore and alternative rock. However, its influence never truly faded. Many of today’s artists, from hip-hop to heavy metal, still borrow elements from Nu Metal’s fusion of rap and rock.</p>
